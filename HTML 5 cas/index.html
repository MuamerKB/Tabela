        <p>At the beginning of World War I, Crnjanski was persecuted as part of the general anti-Serbian retribution of Austria to Princip's assassination in Sarajevo. Instead of being sent to jail, he was drafted to the Austro-Hungarian Army and sent to Galician front to fight against the Russians – where he was wounded in 1915.[3] Crnjanski convalesced in a Vienna war hospital, although just before the end of the war he was sent to the Italian front. After the war, he started studying comparative literature at the University of Belgrade.[1] but he interrupted his studies to go to Vienna, Munich and Paris, spending the winter and Spring of 1921 travelling in France and Italy.[4]</p>
